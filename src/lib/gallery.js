    alt: `compilation of pictures from various sources, with some text.  On the upper-left, it says "Lea Kapp", the 
      artist's name, in a font stylized like neon tube lights.  Under that, it says pronouns: she/her, age: 30, 
      artistic training: 0.  To the right of that text is an image of a woman's face from the webcomic Diamond Dive
      and an image credit to @madamka_art.  Next to the right is an image is a credit to @tigger_inc and a screenshot
      from their anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.  Below that is an image credit to @moonsia and an image from the 
      webcomic The Witch and The Bull.  All three of these images are inclosed within a cyan background within a
      section labeled "favorite artists".  Directly below the name on the left side of the image is a magenta 
      background enclosing four images.  The first is an artistic rendering of a cat, labeled cat.  The second is a 
      collection of red, purple, and blue foods labeled food.  The third is a picture from a DeadMaus concert labeled
      Music.  The final image in this set is of the Electric Forest, and it's labeled nature.  The final section is 
      on a purple background, and contains two words: coder and gamer.  There are three images in this section: on top
      is a computer with a large monitor and neon lights.  On the bottom there's an artistic rendering of an arcade,
      and the last imgage is a picture of Kali from the game League of Legends, a game that the artist no longer plays
      due to its toxic community.`,
    description: `<p>This was actually my first college-level art project.  I needed to take ARTS 102 (Design and 
      Communications) as a prerequisite for web design, and the first step was to create a "mood board," but I didn't 
      have any idea what a mood board was.  I thought the result actually turned out really well, but then I looked at
      my classmates' submissions, and... well, they all did collages.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, "orderly" is a mood, and I still like it.</p>`,

      upper-left to right: a roomba, a handful of quarters, eight coasters (for beverages).  Middle row, from left to 
      right: several la croix cans, a few dice bags, and a clock.  Bottom row:  a silver mixing bowl, a MSU-themed 
      Christmas Wreath, and and a circular air filter.`,
    description: `<p>This was from ARTS 102 from the section on "unity", and my wife really likes it.  She asked
      if I could print it out and hang it on the wall, lol.  I've heard some folks talk about sacred geometry, the 
      idea that certain geometric shapes are somehow connected to a divine power, and as such, even dipictions of this
      geometry can hold divine power themselves.</p>
      <p>I don't think this one has that power.</p>`,

    alt: `a stylized image of the author, Lea Kapp, which has been run through a script that reduced the image to four
      colors, red, yellow, and black.  The image is slightly pixelated and has rough, slightly distorted edges, an 
      intentional side effect from the "refrying" process, explained elsewhere.`,
    description: `<p>This piece is one of my personal favorites.  So much so that you might recognize the
      recolored version from the landing page of this website. The image is a commentary on the selfie, social media,
      and internet culture in general. With the advent of the internet, humans have been barraged with beauty to the 
      point of  atrophy. Artificial perfection is within everyone's fingertips, embedded into our smartphones, which 
      pump out content to the social mediasphere every minute.</p>
      <p>Influencers pump out selfie after selfie after ad post, cranking up the saturation and slapping on that skin 
      smoothing filter, without a care or concern for realism or even the message they're communicating. Images are 
      posted, screenshot, cropped, saturated, re-encoded and blasted back to the social mediasphere, adding to an 
      endless stream of ever-distorting noise. As digital decay rots our bits and brains, we're slowing losing our 
      connection to reality, and nobody cares.</p>
      <p>But hey, it's a pretty good selfie.</p>`,

    description: `<p>Another image tossed to the frier, created in approximately six seconds, a secondary commentary 
      related to "Feeling Cute Might Delete Later, idk." The creation of the refrier script itself emphasizes how 
      ridiculously accessible and thoughtless the creation of art has become.  Anyone can just download my script, 
      install it, and fry up their own images. Perhaps a little more complicated than a filter in an image gallery.  
      Maybe Apple will add the feature in the next iPhone.</p>

      plus the dexterity of an owl.  Not to mention that WICKED beak.  I guess a bear's teeth are already kind of
      scary, but beaks bring it to a whole new level in my opinion.</p>
      <p>Should I mention this is a monster from Dungeons and Dragons? Is that common knowledge yet? You should
      play a game, if you haven't given it a try. Very fun.</p>`,

    description: `<p>My favorite part of this design is how well the colors worked with Van Gogh's images, but I can't
      even take credit for that since these colors were selected by our "client." The large images are constantly the
      focal point of this design, emphasized by their size compared to relatively sparse text on flat colors.`,

      successful while maintaining readability.  It doesn't have the kind of professional look that I tend to gravitate
      toward, but that was intentional, as this website is for a bunch of beach bums who just want to have fun.  I wish
      I could take credit for that logo, but alas, it was AI generated.`,
